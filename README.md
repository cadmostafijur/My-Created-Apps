Android Flashlight
(Light )
This is my first project in Android studio using Java language. 
Here I am accepting camera permission and if light is off and you want to touch(on) then you touch (On) button. Another if light is On and you want to touch(off) then you touch (Off) button. Its app by java and it is designed by png images.
